Set up instruction for object detection

So follow the instruction here to set up. Look below at the  comments before starting
https://tensorflow-object-detection-api-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html
(Some of the commands they provide might be linux commands instead of windows
So in general use \ if / doesnt work and use the command copy instead of cp)

If the computer doent have AVX support use the below version of TF2.2.0 as sadly 2.1.0 does not work
https://github.com/fo40225/tensorflow-windows-wheel/tree/e7d932cf6fd1b85ff47d20fb8215561ea059d317/2.2.0/py38/CPU%2BGPU/cuda110cudnn8sse2
IF you install this version also install CUDA 11.0 and the most recent version of cudnn 8 instead of what the above tutorial says.
(IN the tutorial it says to add <INSTALL_PATH>\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v10.1\extras\CUPTI\libx64 to the path
This is wrong it should actually be lib64 without the x. and what ever version of CUDA is installed.

Finish tutorial instruction
This will go through how to install the required packages
And then will walk through how to set up the file system and label images, and how to setup config file
Then how to train the model from an exisiting model

On the Avian System: use env ObjectDetection2

Export Model
python .\exporter_main_v2.py --input_type image_tensor --pipeline_config_path .\models\my_efficientdet_d0\pipeline.config --trained_checkpoint_dir .\models\my_efficientdet_d0\ --output_directory .\exported-models\my_model

Once model is exported i followed these instruction to use the exported model and create the visualizations
